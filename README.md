This repository contains an iPython notebook to run an [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) query and then make a network graph of the authors in the results, where a "connection" is coauthorship on a paper.

Because the final notebook contains JavaScript (to make a zoomable plot), if you just want to look at the results I got, a visit to the [GitHub Pages version of the notebook](https://msimet.github.io/ads_clouds/index.html) will probably give you a better experience.
